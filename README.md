# Development Environment

* You will require latest version of Android Studio 3.0 (or newer) to be able to build the app
* Android Studio Bumblebee | 2021.1.1 Patch 2 or Higher
* Language: Kotlin
* Build System: Gradle

# API key ðŸ”‘
You'll need to provide API key to fetch the news from the News API Service. Currently the news is fetched from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

- Generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!) from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
- Create new file named -> `secrets.properties` in our project root folder
- Add the API key as shown below [Make sure to keep the double quotes]:
   `API_KEY = "<INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY>"`
- Build the app
- Enjoyyyyy ðŸŽ‰

# Architecture
The app uses MVVM (Model View View Model) architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.
